1. Chest Pain type – chest pains commonly experienced by heart disease patients could be typical or atypical angina pectoris (pain, pressure, squeezing felt by heart muscle), non-anginal pain, or asymptomatic (no pain felt) (“Angina (chest Pain”) These four conditions are indicated by 1,2,3, and 4 in the records as below:
-	1:Typical angina
-	2:Atypical angina
-	3:Non anginal pain
-	4:Asymptomatic
2. Trestbps – resting blood pressure, recorded in mm Hg
3. Chol – serum Cholesterol level in mg/dl
4. Fasting blood sugar level (fastbps) – Intake of eating or drinking liquids other than water is refrained for 8 hours to test for diabetes. If blood sugar level is below 120mg/dl it is recorded false, and true if the level is above 120mg/dl. Binary values are used to record data. 1:true 0:false (“Fasting Blood Sugar Levels”)
5. Resting electrocardiogram (restecg) – resting electrocardiogram is recording of the heart’s electrical activity when it performs excitation and recovery to initiate each heart beat. Integer values from 0 to 2 are used to indicate trends found in patients’ electrocardiogram.  (“Resting Electrocardiogram (EKG)”)
-	0:normal
-	1:ST-T wave abnormality
-	2:Showing probable or definite left vascular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria
6. Thalach – maximum heart rate reached
7.	Exang – exercise induced anginal pain
-	1:yes
-	0:no
8.	Old peak – ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
9.	Slope – the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
-	1:Upsloping
-	2:Flat
-	3:Downsloping
10.	Ca – number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, which is a type of imaging that displays continuous X-ray image while observing the desired area of body. Integer values are used to indicate how many major vessels have been observed. (“Radiation-Emitting Products”)
-	0: zero vessels
-	1: one vessel
-	2: two vessels
-	3: three vessels
11.	Thal – thalassemia 3:normal 6:fixed defect 7:reversible defect
